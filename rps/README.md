# Rock-Paper-Scissors in Jac

A set of Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) games implemented in [Jac language](https://jaseci.org/), demonstrating progressively advanced features including **scale-agnostic execution** and **AI-enhanced commentary**.

## Overview

This repository contains three variations of RPS games:  

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `rps-scale.jac` | Scale-agnostic RPS game. Runs multiple games in parallel using Jac's walker/node architecture. Each turn generates a fresh random computer choice. Can run locally or with `jac serve`. |
| `rps-bestof.jac` | Best-of-N RPS game with scoring. Players compete until one reaches the majority of wins. Handles invalid input and provides round-by-round scores. |
| `rps-with-llm.jac` | AI-enhanced RPS game using `byLLM`. Generates contextual commentary for each round, adding a fun, intelligent twist to the gameplay. |

## Features

- **Walker/Node Architecture:** All games leverage Jacâ€™s object-spatial design, with walkers moving through turn nodes.
- **Scale-Agnostic (`rps-scale.jac`):** Multiple games can run independently, suitable for local CLI or cloud deployment via `jac serve`.
- **Best-of-N Scoring (`rps-bestof.jac`):** Configurable rounds with automatic win detection.
- **AI Commentary (`rps-with-llm.jac`):** Fun hints and contextual responses generated by a language model.

## Requirements

- [Jac Language](https://jaseci.org/) installed  
- Python 3.8+ (for `byLLM` integration in `rps-with-llm.jac`)  
- Internet connection if using AI commentary
