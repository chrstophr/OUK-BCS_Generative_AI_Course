# OUK â€“ BCS Generative AI Course  

This is my personal public repository for the OUK BCS Generative AI seminar.  
It contains my course exercises, project code, experiments, and supporting materials developed throughout the course.  

Feel free to explore the code and resources, but note that this is not the official course repository.
